At the University of Kansas (KU) I served as the instructor for the following courses: *Intermediate Macroeconomics* (Econ 522) during one semester and *Introduction to Econometrics* (Econ 526) for five straight terms. Along with *Intermediate Microeconomics* (Econ 520), these three courses constitute the core set of disciplines for those seeking to major in Economics. 

Additionally, in my first three semesters at KU I also served as Graduate Teaching Assistant for two introductory (freshman level) courses: *Principles of Microeconomics* (Econ 142), and *Principles of Macroeconomics* (Econ 144), serving as the head TA for Econ 142 in my third semester. 

Furthermore, as a graduate student at the University of SÃ£o Paulo in Brazil, I worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for an undergraduate course in Econometrics.
